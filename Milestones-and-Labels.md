When an Issue or Pull Request (PR) are created in general two things are tagged soon after by the authors:

- Label
- Milestone

Milestones are candidate releases, it states when the Issue or PR will most likely fixed by and therefore released.
Some times Issues are new Features or Enhancement requests so the allocation to a Release can change.

Labels are used to classify issues, if it's a bug the label Bug is attached. If the issue is not actionable or is something the author can solve after some help the label Pending is attached.
Other labels like Question or Enhancement are self exploratory, the label Needsowner means that a volunteer is sought to implement and deliver the solution.
The label Epic indicates a new major chunk of work and addition to the software that will most likely drive a Release.
