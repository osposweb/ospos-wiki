# Office Module or Configuration module

Allow to employee (the user) manage the complete system. Start by clicking the Office button. This will load a top list of tabs on screen. **Older versions of opensourcepos (3.0 and earlier) has a "configuration" event a "office"** module.

### Access

The menu and modules presentations are in fact a group divide into two virtual groups: The Office and Home options/groups toggle back and forth between the menu groups.

Permission grants are need to make usable, event if are removed the employee (the user) still can access if already know the URL is for. But in counterpart event is present in main screen, user will not have access if there's no grant permissions, event if already know the URL is for.

## Workflow

* The Office menu/option which appears on the Home menu group can be removed from the Home menu group via a configuration option on the General configuration tab.
* The result of this option is that the user must click on a link or type in the URL in order to access the office menu.
* This isolates it a bit from the home page so that no one will try to go into the office menu away of settings permissions to the employee (the user) and know what the URL is for it.
