The following Import features are supported:

* [Importing Items](#importing-items)
* [Importing Customers](#importing-customers)

# Importing Items

You can manually insert each product one by one, but this becomes cumbersome with large numbers of products.  For this reason, a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) import function has been introduced.

## Prerequisites and file format

CSV file to RFC-4180 specification with commas as the delimeter.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values for more details.

OSPOS will generate your CSV template based on your current data structure.  You can generate this file by going to Items->CSV Import and clicking the link (Download Import CSV Template (CSV))

CSV files with the Byte-Order Mark (BOM) or without it will be processed by the software.
