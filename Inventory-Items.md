## Items and Items Kits

Allow to employee load a product to the inventory so then have some stock. Start by clicking the Items button. This will load up your list of items if there any loaded.

### Access

We can **add, remove, modify and manage** items using the [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) and **use it to sales or returns** in the [Sale Module](Getting-Started-usage#4-sales)

The [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) has a list of available most recent items and also has entries for respective items kits

The [Sale Module](Getting-Started-usage#4-sales) has a input entry to scan barcode or search items/kits by name or barcode numbers, then the list are present and can pickup the items to the current sale.
