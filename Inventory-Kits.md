## Items Kits

Allow to employee group products from inventory so then can sell as combo product by example. This depends of previously loaded [Items](Inventory-Items) to the [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) before usage of the Items Kit feature. Please be sure to learn enough about the [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) and the [Items](Inventory-Items) management.

### Access

Start by clicking the Items Kits module button in main screen. This will load up your list of item kits if there any configured.

We can **add, remove, modify and manage** items using the [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) and **then based on amount of that items build a kit**.

The [Inventory module](Getting-Started-usage#3-inventory) has a list of available most recent items and also has entries for respective items kits
