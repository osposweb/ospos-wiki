# 1: Update Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get upgrade`

# 2: Install Nginx Web Server

`sudo apt-get install nginx`

### After installation, enable Nginx to auto start when Ubuntu is booted

`sudo systemctl enable nginx`

### Start Nginx with this command

`sudo systemctl start nginx`

### Check out its status

`systemctl status nginx`

Now in your browser’s address bar, type `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1` and hit enter

You will see "Welcome to nginx!,
that means nginx installed and running successfully.
### Now, we need to make www-data (Nginx user) as the owner of web root directory

`sudo chown www-data /var/www/html -R`

# 3: Install MariaDB

`sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client`

### MariaDB server should be automatically started. Use systemctl to check its status.

`systemctl status mysql`

### Enable MariaDB to automatically start when Ubuntu is rebooted

`sudo systemctl enable mysql`

### Run the post installation security script

`sudo mysql_secure_installation`

 When it asks you to enter MariaDB root password, press `enter` because you have not set the root password yet. Then enter `y` to set the root password for MariaDB server.

 Next just press Enter to answer all the remaining questions. This will remove anonymous user, disable remote root login and remove test database. This step is a basic requirement for MariaDB database security.

# 4: Install PHP7

`sudo apt-get install php7.0-fpm php7.0-mbstring php7.0-xml php7.0-mysql php7.0-common php7.0-gd php7.0-json php7.0-cli php7.0-curl php7.0-intl php7.0-bcmath php7.0-mcrypt`

### Now start php7.0-fpm

`sudo systemctl start php7.0-fpm`

### Check php7 status

`systemctl status php7.0-fpm`


# 5: Create a Default Nginx Server Block File


### Remove the "default.conf" symlink in "sites-enabled" directory

`sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

### create a new default server block file under /etc/nginx/conf.d/ directory

`sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf`

### Paste the following text into the file, save and close the file




	server {
	server_name localhost;
	root /var/www/html/;
	index index.php index.html index.htm;

	location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
	}
    
	location /opensourcepos/public {
            try_files $uri $uri/ /opensourcepos/public/index.php;
        }
	
	location ~* ^.+.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|xml)$ {
        expires           15d;
	}

	location ~ \.php$ {
        include /etc/nginx/fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www/html/$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param  REQUEST_URI      $request_uri;
        fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING     $query_string;
        fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD   $request_method;
        fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE     $content_type;
        fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH   $content_length;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
	}
	}
### Test nginx configuration and reload it

`sudo nginx -t`

`sudo service nginx restart`


# 6: Test PHP


`php --version`

### Test PHP-FPM, first create a `php_info.php` file in the Web root directory

`sudo nano /var/www/html/php_info.php`

### Paste the following PHP code into the file and save it

`<?php phpinfo(); ?>`

Now in the browser address bar, enter `localhost/php_info.php`. You should see your server’s PHP information. This means PHP is workinging is fine. For your server’s security, you should delete php_info.php file now.

# 7: Install 'Adminer' ('phpmyadmin' equivalent)

Adminer is a free opensource data base management tool like phpmyadmin. It is very ightweight and easy to install. It also support various themes. Download Adminer from here:

 https://github.com/vrana/adminer/releases/download/v4.2.5/adminer-4.2.5.php

 and place it in var/www/html folder.
 To access it, type in your browser `localhost/adminer-4.2.5.php`

# 8: Fix MariaDB bug in ubuntu 16.04

Your Linux OS has a root user. MariaDB also has a root user. So sometimes, when you try to log into MariaDB monitor as root user, MariaDB may authenticate you via the `Unix_Socket plugin` but this plugin is not installed by default. So you see Plugin '`unix_socket`' is not loaded Error.

### Fix this error

First stop MariaDB. If you have installed MariaDB from Ubuntu repository, then use this command to stop it.

`sudo systemctl stop mysql`

### Then start MariaDB with --skip-grant-tables option which bypass user authentication

`sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &`

### Log into MariaDB monitor as root

`mysql -u root`

### Enter the following SQL statement to check which authentication plugin is used for root

`MariaDB [(none)]> select Host,User,plugin from mysql.user where User='root';`

You will see it’s using `unix_socket` plugin. To change it to `mysql_native_password` plugin, execute this command:

`MariaDB [(none)]> update mysql.user set plugin='mysql_native_password';`

### Exit MariaDB monitor

`flush privileges;`
`quit;`

### Stop mysqld_safe

`sudo kill -9 $(pgrep mysql)`

### Start MariaDB again

`sudo systemctl start mysql `

### Now you can use normal password to login

`mysql -u root -p`


## That's all, you have done everything. Enjoy !
