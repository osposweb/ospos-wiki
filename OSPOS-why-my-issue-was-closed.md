Please read carefully **the wiki at [DOCS-USERS-Getting-Started-installations#installation-notes-for-impatients](DOCS-USERS-Getting-Started-installations#installation-notes-for-impatients)** or if you dont like fill the ambigous template, can ask asistant to alternate fork at https://gitlab.com/osposweb/osposweb

# Issue are closed when information requested on the template are not provide, so we are unnable to detect what version in time we will to fix for you!

But if you no have any idea how to start, please there's the point:

# Fill the template are easyle, just the second section are enough: by providing info about version software installed and ospos version installed as minimun.. please fill the second section of issue template! that's all!

IF you still dont understant, so then downloaded with all needed components included and software ready to use at https://sourceforge.net/projects/vegnuli/files/VenenuX-1.0/venenux-1.0-osposweb/debian-venenux-8-osposweb-i386.hybrid.iso/download and can later boot in a virtualBox machine by example. And later:

1. In the wiki maybe there's the need info requested by you..
2. If you are complete newbie, can use a ready to use live ISO, see wiki.
3. Take patiente with youselft, user it's not an administrator as an developer are not an user!
