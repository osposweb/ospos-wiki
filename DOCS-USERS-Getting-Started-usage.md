# 1. Configuration

The **first step its configure the store** at the **Office module** as the screen shot shows:
Please refers to the [OSPOS DOCS USERS Configuration](DOCS-USERS-Configuration) wiki page to learn how to do that.

![MainScreen->Office->click](https://gitlab.com/webvnz/osposos/raw/master/debianOspos/screenshot-ospos-docs-1-startingmenu.png)

Olders versions of the OSPOS dont have the Office module icon so will be as the following screen:

![MainScreen->StoreConfig->click](http://www.opensourceposguide.com/sites/default/files/configuration-new/welcome.jpg)

# 2. Employees

The second its **minimal employee users** that can login in the store. Since OSPOS 3.2.0 the **Employee** module are in the **back Office** store configuration interface. Go to the **Office** module and click on the **Employee** icon module as show here:

![MainScreen->Office->(click)->Employee->(click)](http://www.opensourceposguide.com/sites/default/files/employees-new/employees-tab.jpg)

Please refers to the [OSPOS DOCS USERS Employees](DOCS-USERS-Employees) wiki page to learn how to do that.

# 3. Permissions

There are several tabs related to inventory control.  Before you can add inventory items into the system, though, you have to do some prep work.

# 4. Inventory

# 5. Sales

This its a very complex module in the Open Source POS, due implicates many artifacts and modes, methods of payments and expend receipts. Also needs to print those.

## 5.1. Sales Modes

## 5.2. Sales Restaurant

The OSPOS can be enabled to with a little change work as a POS system for Restaurant sale, by the Table feature. Please refers to the [OSPOS DOCS USERS Sales Restaurant](DOCS-USERS-Sales-Restaurant) wiki page to learn how to do that.
