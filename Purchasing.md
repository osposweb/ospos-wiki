This page is being tossed out as a starting for organizing and collecting design specs for the new purchasing feature.  I'm going to run through all of the issues tonight and start extracting what we've asked for and try to fit them into this organization.  My particular requirements will be to fulfill the purchase tracking needs of a small RV parts, repair, and service shop.

## Requirements/Features

_Please add whatever features you need to have supported by the purchasing module of OSPOS with as much explanation as you feel is needed remembering that terms used in one country or that are industry specific might need to be elaborated so that the developer better understands._

* Must be able to record purchases placed by phone directly to the vendor.  In other words, the status is already "order placed with vendor".

## Definitions/Structure

_Please list industry specific terms with their explanation.  This section will also be the embryonic foundation of the database._

* **Distributor** - OSPOS is distributor-centric, so the businesses providing inventory to an OSPOS shop will always be classified as a distributor (even though technically they could be a manufacturer that we are dealing with directly).  A distributor in OSPOS is typically a wholesale distributor of items that are manufactured and sold by other vendors.
