Hello house,
I am new to opensourcepos 3.0.2 and i must confirm is a wonderful piece.
However, to cut the repetition and time wasted during sales, i will like to know which file to edit or line to comment out to bye pass the 
"are you sure you want to submit this? this sale cannot be undone" message after transaction is completed before proceeding to print out of receipt during sales or return under the SALES module.


Thanks in anticipatation
