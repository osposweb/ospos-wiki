This feature is currently available in both Firefox and Chrome.

### Firefox
Print support is best supported in Firefox by installing the jsPrint addon. After enabling this addon through the standard Firefox addon manager print settings can be configured in the config section. See issues [#431](../issues/431), [#271](../issues/271)

## Chrome
Receipt auto printing is also available in Chrome by using kiosk mode. A printer should be selected once after launching Chrome using a custom shortcut. Issues was originally discussed in [#717](../issues/717). A shortcut should be created adding the `--kiosk-printing` option to the executable. Plenty of resources can be found on the net to do this for [different platforms](https://mycartpos.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200868343-Enable-kiosk-printing-print-automatically-for-Google-Chrome-on-Windows).
