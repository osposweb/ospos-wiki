You have to select the Table, then load the items and suspend the sale to start with a new table.

You then have to go to the suspended button, and unsuspend the table's sale to keep adding items and/or complete the sale.

It's a really awkward and counter-intuitive method, but I guess it works. If you could work a bit more on it, and make it less of a fuss, Open Socurce POS would definitely be a solid POS alternative for restaurants.
