The Open Source Point Of Sale has a featured "Table" inside the **Sale**  module among the lot of rest of features, this brief describe how to use for a restaurant.

The clients are grouped in "Tables", so can sell to a table with no client or with client... ideal for combination of meetings:

* Firts in the **Office** the Restaurant Tables must be enabled.
* A new Selector box will be show in the **Sale** module, aside of the Sale Mode. 
* You have to select the Table...
* Then load the items and suspend the sale to start with a new table.
* For take back other table sale, choose that and have to go to the suspended button
* Unsuspended the table's sale to keep adding items and/or complete the sale.

It's awkward and maybe counter-intuitive method, but it works. In near future will be improved and make it less of a fuss, Open Source POS contributions make it a solid POS alternative for restaurants.
