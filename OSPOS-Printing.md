The printing depends of the print setup and the print behaviour.. The recommend receipt 
is the Star TSP 100 ECO using the Firefox or Chrome browsers, with this if there's no fiscal kit, 
we can print directly. Our recommended label printer is the Zebra LP 2824 Plus printer with 2 x 1 labels. 
Other customers have had success with other printers from companies. If you plan to purchase a different receipt printer than the recommend, try to get one that prints on paper that is 72 mm or greater.

Obviously prints depends of the browser, so must be first configure here, and then in ospos 
the printing configuration has some options, only enable with some changes over the browser.
For the Zebra its recomended also search at https://www.peninsula-group.com/mac-thermal-printer-driver/ 
the CUPS interface for Unixes comes with basic enought support that works as its.

# Advanced and Autoprinting

Advanced printing allows set margins, and the "direct printer" to, only by selecting the "Order" format.

This feature is currently available in combination with browsers Palemoon, Icecat, Iceweasel, Firefox and with some little changes in Chrome. For most modern browsers another way to do by changing deep settings in firefox `about:config` interface options.

### Firefox, Palemoon, Icecat

AutoPrinting support also advanced feature are enabled in two ways, the first using the jsPrint addon at
https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/js-print-setup The supported browsers must be **firefox << 49.9**, **Palemoon >> 24**, and **Icedcat >> 16**. The second way its preconfiguring the browser to printing directly.

Enable jsprint/seamlessprint settings in Firefox, must configure with enable for all the sites (low security, sorry). In some cases newer firefox can try https://addons.mozilla.org/es/firefox/addon/seamless-print/ but not Quamtun Firefox.

After enabling/configure this addon, the ospos print settings will be available and can be configured.

Go to Store config and reselect the printers, occasionally had to select a different printer. Submit. 
Then go back and select the correct printer. Then submit.

**Alternate second way for newer browsers**: Type about:config at Firefoxâ€™s/Palemoon's location bar and hit Enter. Right click at anywhere on the page and select New > Boolean.  Enter the preference name as print.always_print_silent and click OK. Then set the boolean value to true. Restart firefox. This need that the default OS printer must be the desired receipt printer.

### Chrome

Not recommended, but receipt auto printing is also available in Chrome by using kiosk mode. A printer 
should be selected once after launching Chrome using a custom shortcut.

A new icon application launcher or launch/invoke the binary adding the `--kiosk --kiosk-printing ` option 
to the executable. By the way, to make the kiosk mode effecting you need to close all the chrome 
apps and restart otherwise it doesn't work. Open a Terminal, and write the command: `google-chrome --kiosk --kiosk-printing `

After enabling/configure kiosk, the ospos print settings will be available and can be configured.

Go to Store config and reselect the printers, occasionally had to select a different printer. Submit. 
Then go back and select the correct printer. Then submit.

## Fiscal printing

Some countries need some special communications with internal chip in the printers, this feature are 
only done locally and its not possible unless a specific ad-hoc can be done or with special device that 
receive the raw printing and send from the browser to the printer.
