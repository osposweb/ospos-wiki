The printing depends of the print setup and the print behaviour.. The recommend receipt 
is the Star TSP 100 ECO using the Firefox or Chrome browsers, with this if there's no fiscal kit, 
we can print directly. Our recommended label printer is the Zebra LP 2824 Plus printer with 2 x 1 labels. 
Other customers have had success with other printers from companies. If you plan to purchase a different receipt printer than the recommend, try to get one that prints on paper that is 72 mm or greater.

Obviously prints depends of the browser, so must be first configure here, and then in ospos 
the printing configuration has some options, only enable with some changes over the browser.
For the Zebra its recomended also search at https://www.peninsula-group.com/mac-thermal-printer-driver/ 
the CUPS interface for Unixes comes with basic enought support that works as its.
